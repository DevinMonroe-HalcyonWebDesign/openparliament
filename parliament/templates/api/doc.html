<div class="focus">Our <code>API</code> provides access to the structured data underlying this site. It requires a certain level of technical knowledge to use it, but if you've got the know-how, you can use it to quickly build your own tools using Parliamentary data.</div>

<div class="context"><h2>Basics</h2></div>
<div class="focus">
	<p><b>URL structures</b> mirror that of the main site, but on the <code>api.openparliament.ca</code> domain. Most pages will have a JSON link in the footer leading to the equivalent API content.</p>
	<p><b>Everything is JSON.</b> But, when you access the page in your browser (or, specifically, with a client whose <code>Accept</code> header indicates a preference for <code>text/html</code> over <code>application/json</code>), you'll get a friendly formatted page instead. Here, <a href="http://api.openparliament.ca/votes/">take a look</a>.</p>
	<p><b>It&rsquo;s hypertext.</b> Most resources link to related resources. Start with <a href="http://api.openparliament.ca/bills/">bills</a>, <a href="http://api.openparliament.ca/votes/">votes</a>, <a href="http://api.openparliament.ca/politicians/">MPs</a>, <a href="http://api.openparliament.ca/debates/">debates</a>, or <a href="http://api.openparliament.ca/">committees</a>, and you should be able to find your way to what you're looking for.</p>
	<p><b>There&rsquo;s a rate limit.</b> Make more than 30 requests in a minute, and you may get <code>HTTP 429 Too Many Requests</code>. Get in touch if this is a problem for you.</p>
	<p><b>Things change.</b> At the moment, there are no promises of backwards compatibility. If you&rsquo;re using this, you should sign up for a low-traffic <a href="https://groups.google.com/d/forum/openparliament-api">mailing list</a> where I&rsquo;ll post about any breaking changes.</p>
	<p><b>Don&rsquo;t be shy.</b> The API doesn&rsquo;t currently enforce this, but you should put your email in <code>User-Agent</code> headers&mdash;that way I can look at how people are using the API, and contact you if your requests are causing problems. And please get in touch with comments and questions.</p>

<div class="context"><h2>Bulk data</h2></div>
<div class="focus"><p>This kind of API is not especially suited to downloading lots of data at once. For that, <a href="/data-download/">download</a> a copy of this site's database.</p></div><div class="clear"></div>

<div class="context"><h2>Elsewhere</h2></div>
<div class="focus">
	<p>To <b>find ridings or MPs</b> based on addresses or postal codes, use <a href="http://represent.opennorth.ca/">Represent</a>.</p>
	<p><a href="http://parl.gc.ca/">parl.gc.ca</a> has, in recent years, started to include lots of XML data&mdash;that's the original source for 90% of the data on this site. <a href="http://parl.gc.ca/HouseChamberBusiness/ChamberSittings.aspx">Hansard</a> and <a href="http://www.parl.gc.ca/LEGISINFO/">LegisINFO</a> pages will have little orangle XML buttons on them.</p>
	<p><a href="http://parliamentdata.ca/">ParliamentData.ca</a> is an under-construction independently-built API much like this one.</p>

<div class="context"><h2>Copyright</h2></div>
<div class="focus">
	<p>All content on this site comes from Parliament, and so is copyright of Queen Elizabeth. <a href="http://www.parl.gc.ca/information/about/copyright/permission_hoc.asp?Language=E">Speaker&rsquo;s Permission</a> establishes some of the terms of use for some of the content.</p>
	<p>This site holds no copyright on any data accessible through this API. But providing attribution via a link back to openparliament.ca would be awfully nice of you.</p>
